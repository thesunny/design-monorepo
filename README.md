# Font Picker

An interactive web application for exploring, previewing, and managing Google Fonts. Font Picker helps designers and developers discover the perfect typography for their projects.

## What It Does

Font Picker provides a streamlined way to browse hundreds of Google Fonts organized into intuitive categories like Sans Serif, Serif, Display, and Monospace. Instead of navigating through the Google Fonts website, you get all fonts in one place with powerful preview and customization tools.

## Features

### Font Discovery

Browse fonts through a curated, hierarchical catalog. Fonts are organized by style (Sans Serif, Serif, Display, Monospace) and further grouped by characteristics like Modern, Classic, Geometric, and more. Each font shows its available weights and whether it supports italic or variable weight ranges.

### Interactive Previews

See how fonts actually look before committing to them:

- **Headings Mode** - Preview fonts at large display sizes with adjustable weight and spacing
- **Paragraphs Mode** - See fonts in body text context with a grid layout for easy comparison
- **Code Mode** - Evaluate monospace fonts with real code snippets

### Fine-Tuned Customization

Adjust typography settings in real-time:

- Font weight (100-900)
- Line height
- Letter spacing
- Custom preview text to see fonts with your own content

### Smart Filtering

Quickly narrow down options by filtering for fonts that support bold weights, italic styles, or variable font capabilities.

### Favorites Collection

Save specific font configurations with exact weight, line height, and letter spacing settings. Your favorites persist across sessions, making it easy to build and reference your personal typography library. You can save the same font multiple times with different styling configurations for different use cases.

## Why Use Font Picker

- **Faster Discovery** - All Google Fonts organized and searchable in one interface
- **Better Comparisons** - Normalized preview widths let you fairly compare fonts side by side
- **Contextual Previews** - See fonts in the context you'll actually use them (headings, body text, code)
- **Save Your Research** - Keep track of fonts and exact settings you like instead of starting from scratch each time
